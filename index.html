                            A standard for persistent agent state that helps maintain continuity, 
                            reuse tools, and preserve context across agent sessions and even across different agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Agent State is a dedicated Git repository that stores tools, scripts, persistent memory, utilities, and organizational 
                            context. Think of it as a "state layer" for agents—a persistent memory system separate from individual project repositories.

                        <p>
                            Born from real production use. It integrates easily into existing agent setups and helps AI agents work more effectively 
                            by providing a natural environment that mimics developer workflows.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    To make Agent State work, simply add the Agent State repository to your agent's knowledge base or include 
                    instructions about it in your AGENTS.md file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agent needs to understand that it has access to (or ownership of) the Agent State repository and should use it 
                    to store and retrieve tools, scripts, and organizational context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This standard is virtually compatible with every development agent system that has filesystem and Git capabilities. 
                    Once the agent knows about the Agent State repository, it will naturally start using it to persist work across sessions 
                    and share knowledge with other agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've seen it work with systems like Devin, Cursor, and Windsurf, and expect it to work with any agent that can 
                    interact with Git repositories.
                </p>

                <h2>Agent State vs Agents.md</h2>
                <p>
                    These two standards serve different but complementary purposes:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Agents.md</strong> → how agents behave
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Agent State</strong> → where agents persist knowledge
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both standards are complementary and can be used together.
                </p>

                <h2>The Problem We Solved</h2>
                <p>
                    This pattern emerged inside Mottu while scaling Devin to production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with agents at Mottu, where we have thousands of repositories, we noticed they kept 
                    rediscovering the same information, rewriting similar scripts, and losing context between sessions. 
                    This wasted tokens, time, and created frustration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agent State solves this by giving agents a place to store what they learn and create. When agents 
                    write helper scripts, they save them to the repository. When agents learn who owns a system or 
                    which PM worked on a project, that information persists. The next agent session, or even a 
                    different agent, can immediately access this knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>This creates a compounding effect:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Scripts accumulate</strong> Tools and helpers written by agents are saved directly 
                        and reused automatically in future sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Knowledge builds</strong> Context about developers, PMs, systems, and processes 
                        accumulates over time, making agents smarter with each interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Context persists</strong> Agents don't start from scratch; they build on previous 
                        work and stored knowledge from any agent in the organization.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>Here are some concrete examples of how Agent State works in practice:</p>
                
                <h3>Reusable Helper Scripts</h3>
                <p>
                    When an agent struggled with Jira, it wrote a Python helper. Initially, this helper lived as a Devin memory, 
                    requiring regeneration from memory each time it was needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the agent first accessed the script from its knowledge base memory, it immediately wrote a persistent version 
                    to the Agent State repository. Now that helper is automatically reused in every session without needing to be regenerated.
                </p>
                <p class="example-note">
                    Scripts give agents direct access to APIs and external services. Agent State makes these integrations persistent, 
                    so agents don't rebuild the same connections every session.
                </p>

                <h3>Organizational Memory</h3>
                <p>
                    The Agent State repo stores each developer's and PM's GitHub username, the systems they touched, 
                    and their Jira context. Agents can answer questions like "who owns system X" or 
                    "which PM worked on process Y."
                </p>
                <p class="example-note">
                    This organizational memory also enables agents to properly label and add co-authors to PRs, 
                    allowing for better data and attribution in dev lake. Agents can automatically identify 
                    relevant stakeholders and ensure proper credit is given based on the stored organizational context.
                </p>

                <h3>Automatic Inference</h3>
                <p>
                    In systems with good memory reuse like Devin and Windsurf, we've observed that agents often 
                    no longer need explicit repository specifications; they infer context from their stored history.
                </p>
                <p class="example-note">
                    This behavior emerges naturally as the Agent State repository accumulates context. The stored 
                    organizational memory enables agents to make connections about which repositories to use, which 
                    systems are involved, or who to contact, reducing the need for explicit instructions.
                </p>

                <h3>Orchestrator and Sub-Agent Spawning</h3>
                <p>
                    One tool in our Agent State is an orchestrator prompt that uses the Devin API client to spawn sub-agents 
                    for breaking down large tasks, or even spawn a new session for itself—summarizing and creating a new session 
                    to keep the general context of a single session under limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By setting these limits in AGENTS.md, we direct agents to automatically perform this spawning both for large tasks 
                    and when approaching context limits or ACU limits for Devin.
                </p>
                <p class="example-note">
                    The <code>devin_api_client.py</code> script in the Agent State repository enables agents to manage their own 
                    lifecycle, automatically creating new sessions when needed to maintain efficiency and stay within resource constraints.
                </p>

                <h3>Environment Secrets and Configuration</h3>
                <p>
                    Scripts in the Agent State repository can use environment secrets defined in Devin secrets (for Devin) or locally 
                    configured environment variables (for Windsurf and Cursor). This allows scripts to securely access APIs, credentials, 
                    and other sensitive configuration without hardcoding values.
                </p>
                <p class="example-note">
                    Agents can access these secrets through standard environment variable patterns, making scripts portable across 
                    different agent environments while maintaining security best practices.
                </p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                
                <h3>How do I set up an Agent State repository?</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a new Git repository in your organization. You can structure it however makes sense 
                    for your needs, but a common structure includes folders for scripts, memory, docs, and context. 
                    All agents in your organization should have access to this repository.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I have multiple Agent State repositories?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Organizations may maintain multiple Agent State repositories to isolate different types 
                    of information. For example, you might have separate repositories for different teams or 
                    different types of data.
                </p>

                <h3>What should I store in the Agent State repository?</h3>
                <p>
                    Store anything that should persist across sessions: helper scripts agents create, organizational 
                    metadata (developers, systems, ownership), context about processes, and any other information 
                    that helps agents work more effectively.
